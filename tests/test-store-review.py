"""Calibration for the store-review checks in `references/audit-flow.py`.

Repo-only, like everything under `tests/`. Runs the shipped script as a subprocess --
never imports it, so nothing writes a `__pycache__` into `references/`, which the
copy-install path would ship.

Both directions are asserted and they matter equally:

    FIRES   -- an injected defect must be reported, at the stated severity
    SILENT  -- every real export, tracked and raw, must stay clean

Store review is ADVISORY: no case here may assert a `blocker`, and the verdict must
stay clean when store-review findings are the only ones that fired.

Usage: python3 tests/test-store-review.py     # 0 all pass, 1 a case regressed

# screens/locales/products that suppressing every non-store family by subtraction is
# more fragile than building the handful of elements this needs directly), asserted

#
# Fix round 1, second defect: the first version of this config fired only TWO
# `risk`-severity checks, and `render()`'s verdict line reacts only to `blocker` and
# `question` severities -- measured, WITH the partition disabled the exact same
# `[risk, risk]` config still printed `READY FOR PRODUCTION`. So the "unconditional"
# assertions below were true whether the partition worked or not; they proved
# nothing about verdict isolation, only that the section renders. Fixed by adding
# `el_pay`, which fires `external-purchase-link` -- a `question` -- so the config now
# exercises the one severity that actually moves the verdict line, and the fix stays
# in the six-name set so the config is still genuinely store-review-only.
#
# The screen: `el_card` binds Pro Annual (a real, fully-cataloged product -- access
# level set, `app_store` entry present) via a `product` element and a wired
# `purchase` action, so the screen sells and the product passes every catalog check.
# `el_restore`/`el_terms`/`el_privacy`/`el_pay` each carry their OWN interaction
# (restorePurchases, two openUrls shaped like terms/privacy links, and one openUrl
# shaped like a payment link), which is what keeps `dead-affordance` silent --
# `_wired` only needs the element itself or an ancestor to carry an interaction, and
# here it is the element itself, so no `elements.hierarchy` tree is needed at all
# (every hierarchy-consuming helper in this module falls back to the node's own id
# when it finds no match, verified by reading `_find_node`/`_element_blobs`).
# `el_close` carries its own `closeFlow`, which makes `scr_paywall` both an escape
# screen and self-reaching in `_reaches`, silencing `no-escape-in-flow` and
# `no-escape-from-paywall` together. `--stores ios` is passed when running this
# config: Pro Annual has no `play_store` entry, and `product-store-gap`/
# `play-base-plan-missing` only fire for a store actually in `stores` (verified by
# reading `check_products_catalog` -- with `stores={'ios'}`, the missing `android` key
# is skipped by neither branch of its `if stores is None / elif want in stores`), and
# `external-purchase-link` itself requires `'ios' in stores` (or `stores is None`) to
# fire at all. `el_price` binds Pro Annual's `prod_price_per_month` variable -- the
