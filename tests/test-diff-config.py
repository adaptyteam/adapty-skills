"""Calibration for `skills/flow-generator/references/diff-config.py`.

Repo-only, like everything else under `tests/`. It runs the shipped script as a subprocess --
never imports it, so nothing writes a `__pycache__` into `references/`, which the copy-install
path would ship.

Two halves, and both matter equally. A diff that misses a removal loses a colleague's work; a
diff that reports a builder save as destruction gets ignored within a day, and then it loses a
colleague's work too. So every case below asserts a direction:

    FIRES   -- an injected loss must be reported, with the count the report should collapse to
    SILENT  -- a change that destroys nothing must produce nothing

Usage: python3 tests/test-diff-config.py      # 0 all pass, 1 a case regressed
