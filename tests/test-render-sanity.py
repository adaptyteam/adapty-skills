"""Calibration for `render-measure.py --sanity`, the guard `shoot.sh` gates renders on.

Repo-only. Runs the shipped script as a subprocess -- never imports it, so nothing writes a
`__pycache__` into `references/`.

The images are SYNTHESISED here rather than checked in, for the same reason
`tests/render-baseline/` is gitignored: PNG bytes from a real browser are machine-specific, and
a binary fixture nobody can regenerate rots. Each one reproduces the SHAPE of a class measured
on real samples on 2026-08-28:

    error page   flat, ink in one band, and only TEXT-width runs  -> must FAIL (exit 1)
    blank page   one colour, no ink at all                        -> must FAIL
    sparse app   mostly one colour, ink spread down the frame     -> must PASS (exit 0)
    banded app   ink in ONE band but not flat enough              -> must PASS
    dense app    neither flat nor banded                          -> must PASS
    card screen  flat AND banded, but a card edge runs the width  -> must PASS

The last one is the 2026-08-28 report: a correct render of a single reviews carousel was
renamed `NOT-A-RENDER-*`. It is the case the previous two-axis guard could not have got right,
because on those two axes the real render sits BETWEEN two error pages (dom 0.969 / span 0.287,
against conn-refused 0.976 / 0.263 and dns-error 0.972 / 0.333). The third axis -- the longest
CONTIGUOUS run of ink in a row -- separates them 0.139 vs 0.646, because glyphs have gaps
between them and a card edge does not.

Note the error-page fixture below draws TEXT-WIDTH runs. It used to draw solid 250px bars,
which no real error page produces (measured: 0.090-0.139 of the width), and the third axis
correctly began accepting it -- an unfaithful fixture caught by the check it was meant to test.

Usage: python3 tests/test-render-sanity.py       # 0 all pass, 1 a case regressed
