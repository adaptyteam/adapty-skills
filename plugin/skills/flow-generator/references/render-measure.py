"""Measure a flow render, instead of eyeballing it.

Why this exists: "the connector line looks too narrow" sent a whole session's worth of edits
at an element that was exactly the right size. The same screenshot, measured, said the widths
were correct (38 against a 46 chip) and that the real defect was a **14px break** before the
next chip — a gradient fading out onto the page colour. One is a hunch, the other is a bug
report. Reach for this whenever a judgement about a render is about position or size.

Stdlib only (no Pillow): 8-bit non-interlaced PNG, which is what headless Chrome writes.

    # is a column continuous? (connectors, timelines, rails, dividers)
    render-measure.py shot.png --column 23:68
    render-measure.py shot.png --column 23:68 --rows 300:700

    # how wide is a thing, actually? (chips, cards, buttons)
    render-measure.py shot.png --row 343
    render-measure.py shot.png --row 343 --cols 0:120

    # comparing against a reference screenshot at a different scale
    render-measure.py ref.png --column 50:121 --scale 602:390

`--column` reports painted vertical runs and the GAPS between them; zero gaps is what
"connected" means. `--row` reports painted horizontal runs, i.e. widths. Both decide "painted"
by distance from a sampled background pixel, so pick `--bg` inside the page, not on a card.

# Share of one colour above which a PNG is not a render. Reused verbatim from
# `tests/render-check.py`, where it was calibrated against real paywall renders; the page it
# exists to reject is Chrome's own error screen, which measured 99.7% there. Re-measured
# 2026-08-26 on five DNS-error screenshots from a GREEN round: 97.7-98.0% one colour with
# 217-228 distinct colours -- so a colour COUNT cannot catch this and the share can.
MAX_DOMINANT_SHARE = 0.95
# ...but flatness ALONE cannot separate the two classes, and shipping it alone was a real
# false-positive source: four agents in one GREEN round (2026-08-28) had good renders renamed
# `NOT-A-RENDER-*`. Re-measured over 15 real renders and 4 error pages, the ranges OVERLAP --
# real renders run 0.502-0.991 one colour and error pages 0.976-1.000, so a sparse light signup
# screen (0.991) is FLATTER than the DNS-error page the guard exists to catch (0.976).
#
# What does separate them is WHERE the ink sits. An error page is one clump of text in the
# middle of an empty viewport; an app screen distributes content down the frame. `ink span` is
# the vertical extent from the first inked row to the last, over the height:
#
#     error pages   n=4   span 0.000-0.332      (blank page is 0.000)
#     real renders  n=15  span 0.211-1.000
#
# Those overlap too -- a one-section carousel render is legitimately 0.211 -- so NEITHER axis
# works alone and the gate needs BOTH: flag only what is very flat AND confined to a band.
# Against that rule the full set is 19/19 correct, with the nearest real render 0.057 clear on
# flatness (0.893 where 0.95 is needed) and 0.155 clear on span (0.655 where < 0.50 is needed).
MIN_INK_SPAN = 0.50
# ...and flatness AND span TOGETHER are still not enough, which is the second over-fire of this
# guard (2026-08-28, reported after a correct render of a reviews carousel was renamed
# `NOT-A-RENDER-*`). Measured on that capture against four freshly taken Chrome error pages, the
# real render sits INSIDE the error-page range on both existing axes -- it is bracketed, so no
# threshold on them could ever have separated it:
#
#     conn-refused        dom 0.976   span 0.263
#     THE REAL RENDER     dom 0.969   span 0.287
#     dns-error           dom 0.972   span 0.333
#
# What does separate them is the longest CONTIGUOUS run of ink in any row, as a fraction of the
# width. Text cannot produce a long one -- there are gaps between glyphs -- while almost any app
# screen draws a card edge, a divider, a filled button or an image that runs unbroken across
# much of the frame. Measured:
#
#     error pages   n=4   longest run 0.000-0.139   (blank page is 0.000)
#     real renders  n=3   longest run 0.646-0.792   (carousel, one-card, divider)
#
# 0.35 sits in that gap, ~150px at 430 wide, which nothing made of glyphs reaches.
#
# KNOWN LIMITATION, measured rather than assumed: a real screen that is ONLY text (a heading
# alone, 0.042; a paragraph of terms, 0.062) is indistinguishable from an error page on all
# three axes -- it scores LOWER than the error pages do, because Chrome's error page has a solid
# icon and button. That is not a threshold that can be tuned; the two are the same image. It is
# why `shoot.sh` now probes the render host BEFORE launching Chrome: an unreachable host is the
# actual cause of the page this guard was invented to catch, and testing it directly is both
# reliable and 18 seconds cheaper than screenshotting the result.
