# Why this exists: the gates were three separate commands, i.e. three agent turns at ~30 s of
# round-trip each — far more than the checks themselves cost. Order is deliberate: the local
# structural walk first (it names every defect at once), then the schema shape check, then
# `validate` (one fatal per round trip, and the only one that needs the network).
#
# Exit 0 only if nothing blocking was found. `validate` needs an existing flow id purely as a
# target; the call is read-only and saves nothing.
