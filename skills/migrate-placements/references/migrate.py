"""Placement migration helpers: paywall placements -> new flow placements.

Stdlib only. Two traps live here rather than in prose, because prose lost to
both of them before:

1. PAGINATION. `--page-size` defaults to 20 and the response carries
   meta.pagination {count, page, pages}. Reading page 1 and reporting its
   length under-reports a 150-placement app by 130.
2. content_type. A pre-!13221 read omits it and every write requires it
   (CLI-side, exit 2, no request). So a read cannot be written back without
   normalization. The pod already returns it, so this is a compatibility
   shim that becomes a no-op -- it must accept both shapes.

3. is_active. Owner-confirmed as the placement's own enabled/disabled status,
   on both `list` and `get` -- and measured ABSENT in production and on the
   MR !13221 pod. So absence is the common case, absence means UNKNOWN, and
   `select_scope` partitions three ways rather than two.

This module NEVER emits a `placements update` that changes content type: the
backend refuses it with `Placement type can not be changed.`

`plan --flows <ledger>` is how the create argv is produced. `placements
create` has no preview and no prompt, so whatever argv is sent is sent --
which is why the argv is GENERATED here, through `build_create_command` and
`to_flow_audience`, rather than retyped from a doc where the mixed-audience
raise and the `content_type` injection can be skipped by hand.

EXIT CODES, and the split is deliberate because the two demand different
actions from the caller:

    0  fine
    2  it did not work, and the cause was not positively identified as
       internal. Covers everything from "your file has a typo on row 3" to
       "something unexpected happened" -- the message says which, and says
       plainly when it does not know. Read it, check your input, re-run.
    3  a bug in this tool: an invariant THIS MODULE COMPUTED was violated.
       Your input is almost certainly fine. Stop and report it.

THE DEFAULT IS 2 AND EXIT 3 IS OPT-IN. That inversion is the whole design,
and it is here because the other arrangement failed three times.

Exit 3 used to be the catch-all, which made it a claim -- "this is a bug in
migrate.py, your inventory may be fine" -- asserted about every failure
nobody had classified yet. Its correctness therefore depended on having
exhaustively enumerated every way this module can fail, and three successive
attempts to write that enumeration each left holes: a row missing a field, an
audience entry with a declared type and no id, a malformed API response, a
`segment_ids` that is a string. Each attempt was believed complete. The
obligation is not meetable, because an enumeration only ever covers what its
author remembered, while the module keeps growing.

So the promise is gone and a rule stands in its place:

    An unclassified failure is UNKNOWN, and unknown is reported as 2.
    Exit 3 is raised only by `raise InternalError(...)`, at a site where the
    code can say WHY the failure is internal.

The failure mode moves from confidently-wrong to honestly-uncertain. Before,
an unguarded site told the user their file was fine when their file was the
problem; now it tells them something broke and it is not sure why. The false
claim is UNREPRESENTABLE except where somebody deliberately wrote it, which
is this repo's own standard -- make the wrong shape unrepresentable rather
than merely detectable -- applied to the classifier instead of to a config.

Guidance for adding to this module, in place of the old inventory:

  * Validating an input near where it is read still buys a better message,
    and is still worth doing. It is no longer load-bearing for correctness.
  * WHERE YOU GUARD A VALUE'S PRESENCE, GUARD ITS TYPE IN THE SAME PLACE.
    Three separate leaks were this one mistake: `x.get(k) or {}` guards
    FALSINESS, so a list where an object belongs passes and dies on the next
    subscript. `_api_field` exists for exactly this.
  * Never raise `InternalError` for anything a caller handed you -- a file, a
    flag, a CLI response. Those are 2 whether or not you classified them.
  * Do not reintroduce "your input may be fine" on the catch-all path. It is
    the sentence that made the old design wrong.

Five kinds of data arrive from outside and none of them can produce a 3: the
INVENTORY FILE, the FLOWS LEDGER, CLI RESPONSES, CALLER FLAGS (`--page-size`
has an API-imposed range and an agent raising it is the natural mistake), and
the FILESYSTEM. Data this module built itself is the only place an internal
invariant can be asserted about.

    DTO that `list` returns, while audiences are only on `get`, so filtering
    first turns a 150-placement app with 30 active from 2 + 150 calls into
    2 + 30.

    THE POSITION IS SEPARABLE FROM THE PARTITION, and only the position rests
    on `is_active` being on `list`. If it ships on `get` only, this function
    moves after the GET loop and everything it reports -- the three-way split,
    the withheld counts, the fallback -- is unchanged and still needed by the
    scope question, the stub exposure count and the rehearsal order. The only
    casualty is the arithmetic above.

    Two rules are mechanical here rather than remembered:

    1. An all-unknown set under `scope=active` FALLS BACK to every row
       instead of returning empty, and records that it did. On today's API
       that is every account, so the alternative is a tool that reports
       "nothing to migrate" for everyone.
    2. The withheld count is produced by the same code that withholds, so a
       caller cannot report the kept count alone. A filter that hides work is
       worse than no filter -- if `is_active`'s real semantics turn out
       narrower than the activation state the source documents, the filter
       would skip placements that need migrating and the user would never see
       them.

    Note what is deliberately NOT done: under `scope=active` an unknown row
    is filtered out (it is not known-active), but it is counted separately
    from the inactive rows, so the report distinguishes "you disabled these"
    from "I could not tell".

    THE THIRD BUCKET IS REQUIRED, NOT DEFENSIVE, and do not simplify it away
    once the field ships. `paywalls placements` omits `is_active`
    permanently and by design -- its queryset does not annotate the state --
    so one of this skill's own read paths will always return placements whose
    activation is unknown, and collapsing them into `inactive` would mark
    every one of them disabled.

    `flows` is the phase-5 ledger, `paywall_id -> flow_id`. When it is given,
    every row gains a `command` -- the exact argv for `placements create`,
    built by `build_create_command` from audiences built by
    `to_flow_audience`. That is the point: the guards (the mixed-audience
    raise, the `content_type` injection, the verbatim `segment_ids`/
    `priority`) sit on the documented path rather than beside a
    hand-retyped command block. A row whose paywall is not in the ledger
    gets `missing_flows` and NO `command` -- a broken argv is worse than a
    missing one, because `placements create` has no preview and no prompt.

    With `flows=None` the output is exactly what it was before the flag
    existed: no `command` key anywhere.

    `scope` is the block `inventory` recorded (`select_scope`'s report). It
    is copied into `summary['scope']` so the phase-3 report cannot omit what
    the inventory filtered out -- the plan is the only thing later phases
    read, so a count that stops at the inventory file is a count nobody sees.
    An inventory written before the flag existed carries no scope, and then
    `summary` carries no `scope` key.

    `summary['exposure']` is ALWAYS emitted and is a DIFFERENT number: the
    activity split over the placements this plan would actually create, which
    is what phase 6's stub warning has to quote. See the comment at its
    construction for why the two cannot be substituted for one another.

    `existing` is the block `inventory` recorded from `flows list` and
    `paywalls list` (`{'flows': [...], 'paywalls': [...]}`, or an `error`).
    With it, every `flows_needed` row carries the paywall's title and any
    flow already in the account whose name matches it. THAT IS THE POINT: a
    user who has clicked **Move to new builder** on some paywalls already has
