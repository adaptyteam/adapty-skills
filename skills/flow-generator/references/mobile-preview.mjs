/**
 * Build the "Test on Device" link for a saved flow, and render it as a QR code to scan.
 *
 *   npm i --prefix ~/.cache/adapty-flow-qr qrcode        # ONCE, and only if you want the PNG
 *   (cd ~/.cache/adapty-flow-qr && node <this-file> --app <APP_UUID> --flow <FLOW_ID> \
 *     --config /abs/path/flow.working.json --qr)
 *
 * Prints the link, then the flow's locales, then — with --qr — a ready-to-paste markdown image line
 * and either `opened <path>` or the opener command. Without --qr it prints the link alone and never
 * loads `qrcode`.
 *
 * THE QR IS ALWAYS A PNG. --qr writes it, OPENS it in the OS viewer, and prints a ready-to-paste
 * `![...](...)` line for a client that renders images. Opening is the point: a terminal reader gets
 * a window with a code in it rather than a path to act on. --no-open (and CI) skip that and print
 * the opener command instead. There is deliberately no character-art rendering — see preview.md,
 * which records the two attempts and why the arithmetic rules it out.
 *
 * --qr writes `flow-preview-qr-<flowid8>.png` NEXT TO THE CONFIG, i.e. inside the working tree,
 * because a client refuses to render an image outside the directory it resolves from. Pass
 * --md-base <dir> (normally your working directory) to get the markdown path relative to it;
 * without it the path is absolute, which clients reject. --out <path> overrides the location.
 * The image is a throwaway: regenerate rather than keep it, and do not commit it.
 *
 * This is the same link the Flow Builder shows behind its "Test on Device" button. It is pure
 * string construction — no network, no auth, nothing from Adapty's servers — which is why it lives
 * here rather than in the CLI. What it needs is the app id, the flow id, and the flow's locales.
 *
 * IT PREVIEWS WHAT IS SAVED, NOT YOUR LOCAL FILE. The app opens the link and fetches the flow's
 * current draft from Adapty, so `config update` has to have run first. That makes this a phase-5
 * tool, the opposite of `flows config preview`, which renders a local file and never saves.
 * Because the app re-fetches, one link stays good across later writes — hand it over once.
 *
 * Print THIS url freely: it is ~170 characters and every part of it is meaningful. That is the
 * opposite of the `flows config preview` render URL, which is thousands of characters of gzipped
 * base64 and must never be printed (preview.md explains why).
 *
 * PATHS: `--config` and `--out` are resolved against the CURRENT directory, and the install line
 * above runs this from the cache dir. Pass both as ABSOLUTE paths, or the read fails and the PNG
 * lands somewhere you are not looking — the same trap gates.sh documents for its schema step.
 *
 * Exits 0 on success, 1 when the flow has no locales to build a link from, 2 on bad usage.
