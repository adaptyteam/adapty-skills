# Media assets: uploading an image and binding it into a config

`flows media upload` puts a local image file on Adapty's CDN and prints the URL to reference from
a flow config. It is the only asset path an agent has: given a file, an image in an authored flow
is yours to place rather than a user ask.

Everything below was measured against **production** with `adapty` 0.8.0.
Where a claim rests on a render rather than on the endpoint, it says so.

## The call

```bash
$ADAPTY flows media upload --app <APP_UUID> ./hero.png
```

```
Image uploaded!
ID: 516395
Name: hero-600x400.png
URL: https://public-media.adapty.io/public/1e/5b/1e5bbbb4-.../hero-600x400.png
```

The file argument is positional and required; `--app` is the only flag that matters. The printed
URL is **live immediately** — a `curl` against it returned `200 image/png` in the same second as
the upload, so there is no propagation wait to build into the workflow.

**A config needs three values from this command and the human output carries only two.** The
JSON body has a fourth key, `preview_base64` — a base64 WEBP thumbnail, thousands of characters
even for a small source — which the human output suppresses. That is the value a config binds as
`previewValue`, and without it the image draws as a transparent 1×1 until the full asset
downloads (see below). So take `--json`, and **redirect it to a file so the blob never lands in
your context**:

```bash
mkdir -p media
$ADAPTY flows media upload --app "$APP" ./hero.png --json > media/hero.json
MEDIA_ID=$(jq -r .id media/hero.json)
MEDIA_URL=$(jq -r .url media/hero.json)
MEDIA_PREVIEW=$(jq -r '.preview_base64 // empty' media/hero.json)   # may legitimately be empty
```

Reading the file with `jq` keeps the cost at one short string per variable; `cat`-ing it, or
running the command without the redirect, puts the whole thumbnail in front of you for nothing.

**That file is the asset's record, so keep it for the whole run.** `preview_base64` comes back
from this call and from nothing else, and the upload does not deduplicate — re-running it to
recover a value mints a *second* asset with a different id and URL, and leaves the first behind
where no CLI command can remove it. So when you bind an asset you uploaded earlier, read its
three values out of its file. Looking one up later is a file read, not a command.

**A response that hands you an id and a URL and no preview is not telling you the field is
optional.** It is telling you that value was not kept for you. Bind the asset without it and the
screen ships with a hole in it, exactly as if you had never had it — so treat a missing preview
as a value to go and find ([When you have a URL and no preview](#when-you-have-a-url-and-no-preview)),
never as a fact about the format.

## Getting the file: the upload needs a PATH, not a picture

The command reads a file off disk. **An image you can only *see* is not an image you have** — a
screenshot or hero the user pasted or attached into the conversation reaches you as pixels in your
context, and there is no path for it and no way to write one: you cannot re-emit the bytes you were
shown. Checked on a Claude Code install, pasted images are not persisted to disk (`~/.claude/paste-cache`
held text only), and this has to hold across harnesses anyway — this skill runs on four CLIs whose
attachment handling differs.

So resolve every asset to a path, in this order:

1. **A path the user gave you** — typed (`./assets/hero.png`), or dragged into the terminal, which
   most terminals insert as a path. Confirm it reads before you build around it.
2. **A file already in the project** — look for it (`assets/`, `public/`, `design/`) and name what
   you found, so a wrong guess is the user's to catch rather than yours to hide.
3. **A URL the user pointed at** — downloadable, but a download is a side effect: say what you are
   fetching and from where, and get a yes before you fetch. Then upload the downloaded file.
4. **Pasted or attached only, with no path** — **ask for one.** "I can see the hero but I can't
   upload what I can't read from disk — save it anywhere and give me the path." One ask, batched
   with your other asks; until it arrives the element is an empty `values` map, exactly as if no
   asset existed.

**Never guess a path, and never substitute a file that merely looks right.** A guess that misses
fails loudly and safely — exit 2, `Cannot read file: ./hero.png`. The damaging version is the guess
that *hits*: uploading `assets/hero.png` because the name matched, when the user meant the image
they pasted, produces a screen that renders perfectly with the wrong picture in it, and no check in
this skill can tell. If you searched for the file rather than being handed it, say which file you
used.

## What it accepts

| Input | Result |
|---|---|
| PNG, JPEG, WEBP, GIF | uploads |
| **SVG** | **`ApiError: http_500`, reproducible** — see below |
| Anything not an image | `validation_error`: `target_format: value is not a valid enumeration member; permitted: 'JPEG', 'JPEG2000', 'WEBP', 'PNG', 'SVG'` |
| ~2.6 MB file | uploads |
| ~2.95 MB file | bare `http_400`, no message, no `fieldErrors` |

**The size cap is on file bytes, not on dimensions.** Measured both ways: a **3000×2000** PNG at
22 KB uploaded fine, while a **1150×900** PNG at 3.1 MB was refused. The boundary sits between
2,599,724 bytes (accepted) and 2,950,946 bytes (refused), so treat **~2.5 MB as the working
ceiling**. A bare `http_400` with an empty `fieldErrors` on this command means *too large* — the
endpoint says nothing else, so do not go hunting for a config problem.

**SVG is rejected in practice even though both sides claim to support it.** `.svg` is in the CLI's
own MIME map and `SVG` is in the server's permitted-format list, and it still returns `http_500`
on every attempt. So the upload path does **not** replace authored icon SVG: a **monochrome** glyph
stays inline in `_meta.icons` with real `raw` markup, needs no upload at all, and is strictly
better there — see the next section for why. Rasterizing a monochrome glyph to get it past this
endpoint is a downgrade, not a workaround.

**Exit codes:** `0` on success, `1` on any API refusal, `2` on an unreadable local file
(`Cannot read file: ./nope.png`). Read the exit code, not the presence of output.

**The upload is not idempotent and does not deduplicate.** The same bytes uploaded twice produced
two different ids and two different URLs (516395 and 516396). So **upload once per asset and reuse
the URL** through the whole preview loop; re-running the upload each iteration silently litters the
app's media library with duplicates that nobody will be able to tell apart.

## When a graphic cannot be an element, draw it and upload it

The format cannot express every graphic. A multicolour or gradient glyph, an illustration, a radial
glow, a chart, a mesh — none of these is a `text`, a `fill`, an `icon` or a stack of them. **Draw it,
rasterize it, upload it.** That is a real capability now, and leaving a hole in the screen or
substituting a lookalike is worse.

It is a **last** resort, not a first one, because everything an element does an image stops doing.
Work down this ladder and take the first rung that fits:

1. **A monochrome glyph → an `icon` element with `raw` SVG in `_meta.icons`.** Real exports write
   these with `fill="currentColor"`, so the glyph takes its colour from the element's `colorId` —
   which is what makes it follow the theme. Never rasterize this rung. **Do not author the markup
   either**: a `phosphor` name resolves from the renderer's own bundle, so an invented name draws
   blank with correct `raw` sitting right there (flow-schema.md trap 23). Search the bundle —
   `python3 references/icons.py --search arrow` — and let `flowkit.icon()` declare it.
2. **A flat or linear-gradient surface → a `fill`** (with `stops`), on a stack you already have.
3. **A composition → stacks**, using the layout vocabulary before padding or docking.
4. **Nobody has a file → a styled empty `image` and an ASK** (trap 5). This is rung 4, not the
   last rung, and that ordering was measured the expensive way — see below.
5. **Only when the ask cannot be answered:** cut it out of the reference
   ([`crop.py`](crop.py), below), or draw and rasterize it. A crop first, since their pixels beat
   your approximation of them.

**Why the ask outranks both.** Do not order these rungs by fidelity-if-it-works — the real
comparison is crop **versus asking**, and asking wins on the thing that matters:

| | what the user ends up with |
| :--- | :--- |
| placeholder + ask | their **real, full-resolution** asset |
| crop | a **1x** crop of their mockup — lower resolution than their own source, and damaged if keying eats a region that matches the backdrop |
| draw | your guess at someone's design, wearing a finished look |

A reference is nearly always the user's *own* design, so they already have the file — and cropping
someone else's design is excluded on provenance anyway. **So for every legitimate case, asking
strictly dominates.** Crop and draw are for the narrow case where the ask cannot be answered: an
unattended run, or a graphic that exists only inside a flattened mockup.

Measured, and it is why this is stated so bluntly: across three agent runs on a reference built for
this exact rung, **two reached the correct outcome by asking and never touched `crop.py`, while the
one that cropped produced the worst artifact of the three.** The rung is real; it is just not where
you go first.

### Cutting a graphic out of a reference

`crop.py ref.png out.png --box x0,y0,x1,y1 [--key] [--fit WxH]` — stdlib, PNG in / PNG out,
8-bit non-interlaced (a macOS screenshot qualifies, a JPEG does not). `--key` floods the backdrop
away from the border inward, ramps alpha across the anti-aliased band and unpremultiplies it, so
the cutout composites with no rim. Alpha survives the upload round trip (measured — see above), so
a transparent crop is a shipping-grade asset.

It **refuses** rather than guessing, and the refusals are the useful part:

| It says | It means |
| :--- | :--- |
| border is not a flat backdrop | either the box clips the graphic (widen it) or the backdrop is a texture or gradient, which cannot be keyed at all — there is no single colour to remove and a flat screenshot records no alpha |
| N% removed, no graphic in this box | the coordinates are wrong; a reference with a device frame needs its screen bounds located first ([preview.md](preview.md)) |
| Nx into a WxH pt box | the box is in points and the asset scales into it, so a crop from a 1x phone screenshot is soft on a 2x/3x device. Ask for a higher-resolution export; never upscale |

**The one failure it cannot detect is the one you must look for yourself**, which is why `--key`
also writes `out.contact.png` — the cutout over black, over white and over grey. **Look at it.**
A graphic that *contains* the backdrop colour loses that part of itself, because the flood walks
through any region of the key colour that touches the silhouette's edge. Measured on a real
reference sheet: a US flag survived intact (its white stripes are enclosed by red) while the
Finnish, Canadian and French flags beside it came back as their coloured parts alone. An enclosed
region is safe; one that reaches the edge is not, and no threshold separates the two.

Two limits that are about provenance rather than pixels. A crop is right when the reference is
**the user's own design** — cropping a competitor's wordmark into their media library is lifting a
brand asset, not a fidelity win. And a crop is still an upload, so it is still an asset in their
library that no CLI command can remove: crop once, and crop the *visible artwork* rather than a
canvas with margin baked in.

### Three things never become an image

**Text — drawn by you OR cropped from a reference.** Never bake words into a bitmap: a rasterized
price is the exact "renders perfectly, ships a lie" failure this skill has already produced once,
and a missing typeface is a named ask, never a reason to draw the sentence.

**An asset that will never arrive has an exit, and it is not a crop.** When the reference is
someone else's screen the user cannot supply the file at all, so the placeholder is permanent —
that is the case for the missing-assets block's third route, *design around it*
([fidelity.md](fidelity.md)). It is the user's call to make, never yours to assume.

> **The crop rung is the easy way to break this, and it was measured breaking it.** This rule used
> to read "text you would be rasterizing **yourself**", which is about *drawing* — and a crop is
> not drawing, so the exclusion did not obviously reach it. An agent cropped a whole
> server-list card out of a reference, baking in `SERVER LOCATIONS`, `United States`,
> `21.170.236.49`, `Connected` and `Ready`: untranslatable, and the server names and IP are
> **live app data that must never be a picture**. It rendered perfectly and nothing objected.
> **Crop a graphic, never a region containing text or data.** If the region you want is mostly
> text, it is a composition, not an asset — build it, and crop only the graphic inside it.

> **The bar is text-or-data, not *any* text.** A **designed lockup** may be an image: an `image`
> element's `values` map is keyed by **locale**, so a per-locale lockup is expressible, and
> `verify-config.py`'s parity walk collects *every* `_localizable` node regardless of key, image
> maps included. Do not downgrade a lockup to a solid-colour `text` lookalike to avoid baking
> words. See [fidelity.md](fidelity.md) for lettering whose treatment is unreachable.

**Lettering that carries a variable or a price stays a `text`, always** — an image cannot carry
one. If its *treatment* is also unreachable, that is the one place a solid-colour downgrade is
correct, and it ships disclosed.

**Anything selectable.** A group member must be a `product`, a `selectable` or a `tab-item`; an
`image` carrying a `groupId` is inert. So plan cards, toggles and tab bars cannot be pictures of
themselves, however much easier the picture looks.

**Anything whose colour must follow the theme.** An image has **no** appearance variant — the
`values` map is keyed by *locale*, and `IImageElement` has no light/dark hook anywhere. A themed
colour does (`light`/`dark` per entry in `theme.colors`), and this is not hypothetical: two of the
four corpus fixtures define a dark variant for **every** colour they declare (14/14 and 11/11). A
bitmap with a baked-in background is the thing that breaks, which is why:

### If you do rasterize

- **Transparent background, no baked surface.** Measured: alpha survives the upload — the CDN
  re-encodes the file but the served PNG is still RGBA — and it composites cleanly over a dark
  screen with no matte or white box. A transparent glyph is the only bitmap that is theme-safe,
  because the screen's own background shows through it.
- **Draw at 2–3× the box** and size the element in points; the box is in points and the asset
  scales to it (measured), so the source resolution is free. *Not* device-measured — the preview
  renderer is not a retina device — so treat crispness on hardware as something the device check
  confirms.
- **Say that you drew it.** A rasterized graphic looks finished, which is the emoji hazard one
  level up: nothing downstream flags an agent-drawn illustration, so name it as yours and as
  replaceable, or the user ships your sketch believing a designer made it.

## Binding the URL: two different shapes

An uploaded URL has two consumers, and they take **different shapes**. Getting this wrong is a
silent defect — no gate catches it (see below).

**An `image` element** wraps the value in the per-locale localizable map:

```json
{"id": "el_PSJTQ6QeQt", "type": "image", "props": {
  "image": {"_localizable": true, "values": {"en": {
    "id": "516395", "url": "https://…/hero.png", "previewValue": "UklGRhQJAABXRUJQVlA4…"}}},
  "width": {"type": "fixed", "value": 242}, "height": {"type": "hug"},
  "objectFit": "cover", "borderRadius": {"tl": 20, "tr": 20, "bl": 20, "br": 20}}}
```

**A background fill** on a screen's or stack's `props.fill` takes the image **flat**, with no
`values` map and no `_localizable`:

```json
"fill": {"type": "image",
         "image": {"id": "516395", "url": "https://…/hero.png",
                   "previewValue": "UklGRhQJAABXRUJQVlA4…"},
         "color": {"type": "hex", "hex": "#FFFFFF"}}
```

Because the element form is localizable, **a different asset per locale is expressible** — the
`values` map is keyed by locale code exactly like copy. A fill is not localizable, so a background
that must change per language has to be an element.

**Write the `id` as a string.** The command prints a number and `--json` returns a JSON integer
(`"id": 516395`), while the schema's `IImage` declares `id` as a required `string` and every real
builder export carries it quoted. Stringify it as you bind it.

## `previewValue`: what the user sees before the image arrives

`IImage` is `{id, url, previewValue?}`, and the third field is what the renderer paints **while
the full asset downloads** — a tiny base64 thumbnail, blurred up to fill the box, so the screen
is composed from the first frame. Leave it out and the renderer has nothing to paint, so it
substitutes a **transparent 1×1**: the layout is right and the picture is a hole, for as long as
the download takes. On a fast connection that is a blink. On a slow one it is the whole first
impression of a paywall.

Bind it exactly as the upload returned it:

- **Bare base64, no `data:` prefix.** `preview_base64` is a half-size WEBP; the renderer's own
  1×1 fallback is bare base64 too. A data URI is not the same string and does not belong here.
- **Omit the key only when the upload itself returned nothing.** `preview_base64` is nullable —
  preview generation can fail — and the field is optional, so that document is legal. Never write
  `null` or `""` to fill the slot, and never reach for this bullet to cover a value you had and
  lost: *the upload gave me none* and *I did not capture it* are different situations that produce
  the same JSON, and only the first one is finished work. Say which one it was.
- **It rides with the asset, not with the element.** The same three-field `IImage` goes into a
  per-locale `values` entry on an element and flat inside a fill, so a background needs it just
  as much — more visibly, since a background is usually the largest thing on the screen.
- **A config is where it is stored.** Because the whole `IImage` is written into the flow, an
  asset already bound somewhere carries its preview there, and that is what makes a lost one
  recoverable — see below.

## When you have a URL and no preview

Reuse is the ordinary way to get here: the asset went up an hour ago, or into another flow
entirely, and what you are holding now is a URL. Work down this ladder and take the first rung
that fits. **Do not skip to the bottom** — rung 3 mints a duplicate nobody can delete, and rung 4
is work you hand back to the user.

| What you have | What to do |
|---|---|
| **An upload you ran** | Its record file has all three values. Read them back out of it. |
| **The asset bound in some flow** | Fetch that config and lift the preview out by URL — one read, nothing minted, and the value is the API's own. |
| **The local file, and no record** | Re-upload it with `--json`. You get a *second* asset with a different id and URL: bind the new one everywhere on this screen, and say in the handoff that the media library now holds a duplicate. |
| **Only the URL** | Hand it back: the user re-uploads that image in the builder, which writes the field for them. Name the elements, so they know which. |

Rung 2 is the one worth a recipe, and it is how you reuse an asset across flows — read it out of
the config that already binds it rather than uploading the file again:

```bash
$ADAPTY flows config get <FLOW_ID> --app "$APP" --json > other.json
jq -r --arg u "$MEDIA_URL" \
  '[.. | objects | select(.url? == $u and (.previewValue? // "") != "")][0].previewValue // empty' \
  other.json
```

Redirect and `jq` for the same reason as the upload: a config runs to six figures of characters,
and the value you want is one string inside it. The walk is over the whole document because the
same asset binds two ways — a per-locale `values` entry on an element, flat inside a fill — and
either one carries the field.

**An empty result is the common case, and it means the agent that bound it dropped the field —
not that the field is optional.** Only an asset bound *with* a preview can hand one back, so
anything written before this rule, and anything the dashboard's paywall conversion moved over,
comes back empty. Fall through to the next rung; do not conclude anything about the format.

That is also the line `verify-config.py` draws. It reports the images **your draft added** and
stays quiet about ones that arrived with the config — not because an inherited one cannot be
fixed, but because fixing it means editing an asset someone else bound, which is a change to
report and offer rather than to make silently.

## No gate catches an image defect. Only the render does.

Measured on one config, five ways — real URL with a string `id`, with a numeric `id`, with no
`id` at all, with no `previewValue`, and with an empty `values` map:

- **`flows config validate` returned `valid: true` for all four.** An image is not part of the
  publish gate, so **a flow whose hero is still an empty placeholder publishes cleanly** and ships
  an "Upload Image" checkerboard to real users.
- **The schema check passed all four too**, including the missing required `id`. The reason is
  structural and worth knowing: `ILocalizable.values` is typed
  `additionalProperties: {"$comment": "unhandled type: T"}`, i.e. completely unconstrained — so
  anything inside a localizable wrapper is invisible to the schema, `IImage`'s `required` included.
- **The render is the only check that sees any of it**, and only once a real URL is in place.

That is the whole argument for the ordering in the workflow: the image is verified by looking at a
screenshot, so the asset has to be in the config **before** the preview loop, not after it.

## Geometry: what changes when the asset lands

`objectFit` has exactly **two** legal values, `fit` and `cover` — not the CSS set. Measured render
boxes for one 600×400 (1.5:1) asset in a 242-wide slot:

| `height` | `objectFit` | drawn box | what happens |
|---|---|---|---|
| `hug` | either | **242×161** | height derived from the **asset's** aspect; `objectFit` has no visible effect, and a `value` left on the `hug` size is dead |
| `fixed: 300` | `cover` | 242×300 | the box wins, the asset is cropped to fill it |
| `fixed: 300` | `fit` | 242×161, centred | the box wins, the asset letterboxes inside it, leaving **139 px of dead band** |
| *empty `values`* | — | **242×256** | the placeholder checkerboard, near-square whatever the real asset's aspect is |

Two consequences an author acts on:

**A placeholder does not occupy the space the real asset will.** The empty map drew **95 px taller**
than the same element with the real 3:2 image — on a 932 px screen, a tenth of the height, and
everything below it moves. A layout previewed with placeholders is a layout that has not been
checked. Upload first.

**Crop transparent margins off before you upload: the BOX is the asset, so padding baked into a
PNG becomes layout.** An `image` box is filled by the whole canvas, alpha included, so a glyph
centred in a generously-padded export draws smaller than its box and pushes its neighbours away by
the difference. Measured across a six-asset set exported from a design file: the opaque
ink was **65–87%** of the canvas height (`ink/canvas` of 0.649, 0.706, 0.707, 0.724, 0.735, 0.870),
so a 302 px box drew a 196 px illustration and spent **106 px on nothing**. Sizing the box to the
*visible* artwork then requires dividing by that ratio per asset, which is guesswork; cropping to
the alpha bounding box first makes the box the artwork and the arithmetic disappear.

```bash
python3 -c "from PIL import Image; im=Image.open('in.png').convert('RGBA'); \
im.crop(im.getchannel('A').getbbox()).save('out.png')"
```

Two riders. **Crop before the first upload, not after** — the upload does not deduplicate and
`flows media` has no delete, so a re-crop leaves the uncropped copies in the user's library
permanently (this cost six orphans on the build that produced this note; disclose them). And
because the box is in **points** while the asset scales to it, upsample the crop 2–3× on the way
out: it costs bytes well inside the ~2.5 MB cap and keeps the artwork crisp on a retina device,
which no preview render can confirm.

**`hug` reflows and `fixed` does not.** With `hug`, the element's height is a function of the file
you upload, so swapping a 3:2 asset for a 4:5 one silently rewrites the screen. With `fixed`, the
box holds and the asset absorbs the mismatch — `cover` by cropping (choose it when the subject is
centred and the edges are expendable) and `fit` by leaving bands (which on a dark screen read as a
spacing bug rather than as an image, so prefer `cover` unless the whole asset must be visible).

## Still out of reach

- **SVG upload** — `http_500` (above). Icons stay authored inline in `_meta.icons`.
- **Video.** No CLI path for the *source* — but the element is not out of reach. Place a real
  `video` element with `customMediaID`/`video` unset: it renders a styled **"Upload Video"**
  placeholder (like an empty `image`), publishes clean (`validate` → `valid: true`, measured),
  and the user binds the clip in the builder. Style it (`loop`, `objectFit`,
  `borderRadius`, fixed height) and report it as an upload ask. **Never** substitute a `stack` with
  a Play icon — that ships a lookalike of a different element type (flow-schema.md trap 5).
  Use [`flowkit.video()`](flowkit.py) or the catalog's `video-hero` / `video-card`; both emit the
  element with no source and refuse to be handed one. See **The video placeholder** below for the
  three measurements that shape it.
- **Fonts.** Still a manual Flow Builder upload; a typeface the account lacks is a named ask, not a
  silent substitution.
- **Deleting or listing uploaded media.** `flows media` has only `upload`, so an upload cannot be
  undone from the CLI — one more reason not to re-upload per iteration.

## The video placeholder

Everything here was measured on 2026-09-10 against the real transform service and the render
(`app_finance`, `adapty` 0.8.2), because a video is the one asset whose upload is **never** the
agent's — so the placeholder is not a provisional state to be cleared later in the same run, it
is what gets handed over.

**It is publishable, and it reaches a device.** An unset `video` returned `valid: true, issues:
[]` in three forms — fully styled, with an empty `values` map, and bare with nothing but a
`position`. `IVideoElement` is `x-supported: true` in the published schema, so unlike
[`old-price`](flow-schema.md) it has a mapper handler and is not a preview-only element.

**A fixed height is the one thing that matters, and `hug` is the trap.** With `height: fixed`
the box is honoured to the point — `fixed_h: 200` drew exactly 200. With `height: hug` the
placeholder draws an arbitrary **256pt**: the renderer's default, the same box an empty `image`
draws, and no function of a clip nobody has uploaded yet. So a hug-height video means the
layout that was previewed and approved is not the layout that ships, and everything below the
video moves when the file lands. `flowkit.video()` therefore has no default for `fixed_h`, and
`verify-config.py` warns on a hug height.

**The checkerboard ignores `borderRadius` — author it anyway.** Corner profiles measured flat at
`borderRadius: 16`, and an empty `image` at the same radius measured **identical**, so this is
the placeholder drawing unclipped rather than anything video-specific. Do not "fix" the square
corners you see in the preview by deleting the radius: it is what the clip lands into, and the
radius is also what makes the box read as part of the design instead of a default block. The
same goes for the size and the margins — take them from the surrounding design, the way you
would for an `image`, because the user can restyle this element like any other media element and
should not have to.

**What the element has no room for.** `IVideoElementProps` carries `animation`, `border`,
`borderRadius`, `customMediaID`, `effects`, `height`, `loop`, `margin`, `objectFit`, `opacity`,
`position`, `rotation`, `video`, `visibility`, `width` — and **no `fill`, no `align`, no
`layout`**. To place it, position the parent stack.

**Not observed in any real export.** 0 `video` elements across the 12 tracked and raw configs,
so this shape is authored from the schema plus the measurements above — evidence tier 3, not a
read off builder output. Treat the device check as load-bearing rather than ceremonial.
