"""Verify the referential invariants of an Adapty flow config.

SCOPE: this SHIPS. It sits in `references/` alongside `validate-with-schema.mjs`, so it is
available to a runtime agent on any machine, not just inside the skills repo. Run it on the
config you are about to write, on a config you fetched, and on a fixture after re-sanitising
it. Every check is local and read-only: it opens one or more JSON files and prints findings.

    python3 references/verify-config.py draft.json          # from the skill directory
    python3 skills/flow-generator/references/verify-config.py tests/fixtures/*.json

It answers a third question the other two gates do not. `flows config validate` answers *is
this publishable* and skips most prop shapes; a schema check answers *are these props
well-formed* and knows nothing about publishability; this answers *do the document's internal
references agree* — and it owns outright the rows neither of the others looks at, notably
anything to do with an image, a top-level `status`/`id`, and a missing `states` key.

History worth keeping: this was called `verify-fixture.py` and lived in `tests/` until 2026-08-25 and therefore did NOT ship,
which quietly weakened several rules the repo had already escalated from prose to a mechanical
check -- every GREEN round that scored against those guards ran in-repo, where the file
existed, so the closures did not transfer to a customer install. Moving it here is what makes
them real everywhere.

Checks, in order: map keys match element ids; hierarchy references resolve;
navigate targets resolve; product elements AND `const` purchase targets are
declared in _meta.screens;
price variables name a field in the closed product set and reference declared
products, across all three families (prod_/offer_/is_); selectableGroups and groupId agree
both ways; font.preset and colorId resolve in the file's own theme;
font.family resolves in _meta.fonts; every icon used appears in _meta.icons;
image elements carry a bound asset with a string id, since neither publish-time
gate looks at an image at all; no id is declared twice in any id-keyed
collection, and theme colour and typography ids do not collide; element types the transform
service has no mapper for; a "$X.XX" template placeholder left in visible copy; and text that
cannot be told apart from its own background, in BOTH appearance variants.
Unreferenced components are reported as warnings, because real exports have them.

Severity rule: an ERROR is a publish blocker or a corrupt document; a WARNING is something
that publishes cleanly and renders wrong. A `const` matching no selection and a variable with
no producer are both the latter -- and the first of those is present in a real raw export, so
it is not a defect this repo introduced by sanitizing.

Usage: verify-config.py [--baseline <config.json>] <config.json> [more.json ...]

`--baseline` additionally reports prices, discounts and durations written as literal text that
the baseline does not contain. It is off by default because real exports legitimately carry
hand-typed ones -- only a literal a document ADDS is evidence of a fabricated claim. Pass the
config you fetched (phase 2's backup) when checking a draft you are about to write.

Exit 0 if every file is clean (warnings allowed), 1 if any invariant is violated.

#   * the currency pattern must NOT require a non-alphanumeric before the symbol, or every
