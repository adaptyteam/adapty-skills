"""Structurally diff two Adapty flow configs, and name what the newer one DESTROYS.

SCOPE: this SHIPS. It sits in `references/` alongside `verify-config.py`, so a runtime agent
has it on any machine. Everything it does is local and read-only: it opens two JSON files and
prints findings. Either side may be a `config get`/`config update` envelope or a bare config.

    python3 references/diff-config.py flow.working.json draft.json     # what my write removes
    python3 references/diff-config.py stale-local.json flow.working.json   # what a human changed

Why it exists. `config update` replaces the whole config, and `--expected-updated-at` only
catches a write racing an edit that landed AFTER you fetched. It cannot catch the commoner
loss: an agent that fetches fresh, then writes a document it regenerated from its own build
script, or patched a leftover local file from an earlier session. The lock token is valid, no
409 is raised, and every dashboard edit made in between is gone. The observable those paths
share is that the bytes about to be written differ from the live config in ways nobody
intended -- so this computes that difference instead of trusting a narration of it.

TWO USES, one comparison. B is always the newer document.

  1. `diff-config.py <live> <draft>` before a write -- REMOVES is what your write destroys.
     Every line of it belongs in the phase-5 approval ask, traced to something the user asked
     for. A removal you cannot trace is someone else's work: name it and ask.

  2. `diff-config.py <old local copy> <live>` at the start of a follow-up run -- here ADDS and
     CHANGES are the human's manual edits, the ones a rebuild would silently drop. This is the
     only way to see them; the config carries no authorship and no history.

Exit codes: 0 no removals, 1 removals present, 2 unreadable file or the same path twice.
**Exit 1 is a disclosure obligation, not a defect.** Deleting a screen is a transform this
skill supports; doing it without saying so is not. Never "fix" a 1 by reverting -- report it.

WHAT IT COMPARES (identity in brackets -- a fact whose identity changes reads as one removal
plus one addition, which is the honest reading of an id rewrite):
  screens [id], elements per screen [id], components [id], locales [code], theme colours and
  typography presets [id], variables [id], `_meta.icons` [name+weight], `_meta.fonts` [family],
  `_meta.screens[].products[]` [product id] and `screens[].products` [product id + offer id] --
  the builder-owned attachments and the registry they derive from, both of which a rebuilt config
  wipes -- element `type`, `props`, `interactions` and screen `caption`, plus every localizable
  value BY LOCALE, so a dropped translation is a removal rather than a change.

WHAT IT DOES NOT SEE, and each of these is a real way to lose work invisibly to this check:
  * rendering. Two configs can differ everywhere here and draw the same screen, and vice versa
    (preview.md). This is a structural diff, not a visual one -- phase 5 needs both.
  * key ORDER, and the order of an id-keyed collection. Both are invisible by design -- values
    are compared with sorted keys, and a collection is addressed by identity rather than index --
    so a builder save that re-sorts `_meta.icons` reads as silent. Do not conclude from a clean
    diff that your bytes equal theirs.
    The v9 -> v10 fill migration is the exception and is NOT silent (measured: 29 fills rewritten
    object -> array reported as 25 changed elements). It changes the shape of a value, so it is
    reported like any other change. Recognise it -- a block of `props` changes across unrelated
    elements right after someone saved in the builder -- rather than reading it as their edits.
  * anything under a key it does not enumerate. A top-level key the format gains next release
    is compared as a whole blob under `other:<key>`, which is coarse but never silent.
