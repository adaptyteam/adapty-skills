# Rendering a config, and what a render cannot tell you

`SKILL.md` phase 4 owns the loop. This file owns the evidence: why each rule exists, what the
render is blind to, and what to do when it fails. Read it when a render surprises you.

## Why the URL is not for reading

**Fully local**: no `--app`, no flow id, no auth, no network, no save. The whole config rides in
the URL fragment, so this works on a file you have not written anywhere. It accepts either a
`config get` envelope or a bare config; `screens` must be an array.

**Never print or read the URL.** It is thousands of characters of gzipped base64 — 6,349 for a
56KB config, ~113K for a 668KB flow — and it carries zero information you can act on. On a TTY the
command opens a browser and prints nothing else. **Piped without `--json` it prints the bare URL**,
which is the form you want.

**Do not add `--json` here.** It prints `{"render_url": "…"}`, an object — not the URL. An agent
that captured that into `$URL` and handed it to Chrome silently screenshotted the browser's new-tab
page and nearly reported it as the paywall. Use the bare form:

## What the screenshot is evidence of

**What this catches, precisely.** It catches the class no structural check can see: wrong
spacing, a magic-number indent, a detached element, a state that is silently wrong. It does
**not** subsume [Verify](../SKILL.md#verify) — both defects in trap 10 were injected into a known-good
config and measured, and both still rendered. They lost a selected-tab highlight and nothing
else, which is visible to someone who knows what the screen should look like and invisible to
any "did anything draw" test. The structural rows catch them for free; keep walking them.

## Comparing against a reference image

**If the user gave you a reference image, compare against the image — not your memory of it.**
Save the attachment to a file the moment you receive it, and re-open it beside every render you
take. A description you wrote after one look is not the reference: building from one produced a
timeline whose rail *width* was right to the pixel and whose *continuity, colour order and last-row
rail* were all wrong, none of which was visible without the two images side by side. If the image
has already dropped out of context, it is recoverable — user attachments are stored base64 in the
session transcript (`~/.claude/projects/<project>/<session>.jsonl`, blocks with
`"type":"image"`) — so extract it rather than guessing again.

Comparing means *measuring*, not glancing. [`render-measure.py`](render-measure.py) does it for either image —
`--row Y` for widths, `--column X0:X1` for painted runs and the gaps between them, and
`--scale <image-width>:<device-points>` to convert a reference's pixels into the numbers you put in
a config.
That is how the rail was confirmed correct at 46/38 while the eye kept insisting it was too narrow,
and how the real defect — a 14px break between connector and chip — was found.

**A mockup that shows a device frame needs its screen bounds located before any of that**, and
fractional coordinates read off the picture are worthless until you have them. Find them from
**row means across the phone's width**, not from a single column: a column through the artwork
hits dark glyphs and dark pixels in a hero image, which truncates the run and yields a band that
is confidently wrong — it took three attempts on one mockup, each producing a different "screen
height", before the row-mean scan gave the real 393×875. With true bounds, sampling the palette
becomes exact: three independent samples of the same accent returned the identical hex.

## What a render costs, and which knobs do nothing

The screenshot is the most expensive step in the whole workflow, so it is worth knowing what
actually drives it. Measured on one config, same machine:

| | |
|---|---|
| One headless screenshot | **17-20 s** |
| `flows config preview` (the URL) | **0.08-0.11 s** — and a 187 KB config is no slower than a 57 KB one |
| `--virtual-time-budget` 5000 vs 9000 ms | **byte-identical output**, 20.2 s vs 17.1 s |
| `--virtual-time-budget` 1500 ms | **no file at all**, and the wait runs to your timeout |
| 3 Chrome instances at once | did **not** finish in 120 s, when one alone takes 18 s |

So *when the host is fast* the cost is Chrome's **cold start** — not the page, not the config size,
and not the budget.

**Corrected the same day, and the correction matters more than the table:** when the render host
is *slow*, the budget is the only thing that decides whether you get a file at all. Measured on a
slow afternoon — an 8 s budget produced nothing for a config that had rendered fine hours earlier,
Playwright timed out at 30 s on `domcontentloaded`, and **a 60 s budget produced a correct
screenshot ~72 s later**. The same page loaded normally in a real (non-headless) browser
throughout. So **"no file" is far more often a slow host than a broken config**: escalate the
budget, then check the URL in a real browser, and only then suspect your work.
[`shoot.sh`](shoot.sh) retries at 60 s automatically.

Three consequences:

- **The number of renders is the cost of phase 4.** Render the screens you changed, not every
  screen. A seven-screen re-render to check one edit is six launches of pure waste.
- **Do not tune the budget *down*.** Lowering it buys nothing on a fast host and yields no file at
  all below a threshold, and the failure looks exactly like a hung render rather than a bad flag.
  Raising it is the correct response to an empty shot — see the correction above.
- **Do not parallelise.** Instances contend; `--user-data-dir` (the obvious fix for that) makes
  the launch fail outright, which is a second way to lose a minute.

**Join the screenshots into one strip before looking**, with
[`montage.py`](montage.py) — `montage.py strip.png a.png b.png c.png`. It is pure stdlib, so
there is nothing to install. That turns N inspections into one, and a before/after pair only reads
as a *difference* when the halves are adjacent; `--gutter 0` butts them together when you are
comparing pixel positions rather than eyeballing.

## Two things a render equates that the config does not

- **An identical screenshot is not an identical config.** Measured: deleting an entire
  `bottom-sheet` element gave a **byte-identical** render, because the sheet was hidden in the
  state that draws. So a before/after pair that looks the same is not evidence the change was
  cosmetic — it may be evidence the change is invisible *in this state*. Structural summaries are
  what cover the gap, which is why the phase-5 approval ask has a second list for changes with
  nothing to see.
- **The page renders one screen and does not walk the flow.** Measured: a button carrying a
  `navigate` action left the page where it was, across two real clicks and a synthetic dispatch.
  So a multi-screen change is N separate renders, and opening N tabs buys noise rather than a
  walkthrough; branching cannot be exercised here at all.

## What a render cannot show you

What to know before a screenshot becomes an overclaim — mostly things it cannot show you, and
one it shows that is not there:

- **A stranded variable.** The render prints an unresolved reference as its literal token, so a
  screen reading `{{name.value}}` looks *pixel-identical* whether its producer still exists or was
  deleted three screens ago — measured, two renders with the same MD5. Whether a consumer still
  has a producer is a Verify question (invariant 12) and preview will never answer it.
- **A `states[].condition` — but *not* a `visibility` one.** The two behave oppositely and the
  difference is easy to get backwards. A **`visibility: {"type": "conditional", …}`** condition
  **is** evaluated: a conditionally-shown button correctly appears or hides in the render, which
  makes the empty-field state of a form gate genuinely checkable here. A **`states[].condition`**
  is **not**: every element draws in its base props, measured on the disable-until-filled probe
  where four buttons carrying `disabled`-state conditions all drew in base teal. That asymmetry is
  survivable only because a conditional `disabled` state is not a real mechanism anyway — see
  [flow-schema.md](flow-schema.md#making-a-field-mandatory-show-the-button-conditionally).
  What the render still cannot tell you about a `visibility` condition: **an unresolvable variable
  is silently treated as empty**, so `empty` over a typo'd id renders exactly like `empty` over a
  real empty field. Only the *flip* — filling the field and watching the element appear — proves a
  reference resolves, and that needs the Adapty app. A wrong *operator* name, by contrast, fails
  closed and the element just vanishes.
- **It can draw something the device will not — the blindnesses are not all one-directional.**
  `old-price` renders a struck-through price in this preview and renders **nothing** in the Adapty
  app (measured, same config). Every other item in this list is preview showing you *less* than
  reality; this one shows you *more*, which is worse, because a layout built around a phantom
  element looks correct here and ships broken. Treat an element you have only ever seen in this
  renderer as unproven no matter how right it looks — see
  [flow-schema.md](flow-schema.md#old-price-a-real-element-that-does-not-draw-on-device).
  **The mechanism is knowable without a device**, which narrows this blindness usefully: this page
  renders the config, a device renders the *transformer's output*, so an element the transform
  service has no mapper for can only ever appear here. The schema flags those — `old-price` is one
  — so check [`x-supported`](flow-schema.md#the-schema-tells-you-what-the-transformer-handles-x-supported)
  before you trust this renderer on an element type you have not shipped before.
- **Selection in a `toggle` or a `multi_choice` group — but `single_choice` and `product` DO
  draw.** The boundary is per group type, and it is narrower than "not a product group". Measured:
  a `product` group's `default` renders selected (the chosen plan card shows its selected
  styling), and so does a **`single_choice`** row — `propsByState.selected` fires, accent border
  and swapped tick included. A **`toggle`** is ignored entirely: flipping `default` between `true`
  and `false` on a toggle row produced byte-identical screenshots. A **`multi_choice`** is ignored
  too: measured on a 7-row market picker whose first row carried `default: true`, the
  render drew every row unselected while a `single_choice` screen in the same config drew its
  default row selected.
  **You can borrow the renderer to see a toggle's on-state.** Since `single_choice` selection
  *does* draw, temporarily retype the group `"type": "toggle"` → `"single_choice"` in a throwaway
  copy, render that, look at the on-state, and revert. Used on a real build to confirm a trial
  card's selected styling — the coral border, the swapped check indicator and a strip of copy that
  only exists when selected — none of which the toggle form will ever show you. Keep it in a
  separate file so the shipped config is never the retyped one.

  **So a `multi_choice` row drawing unselected is not a defect to chase** — confirm `default` in
  the config and move on; "fixing" a correct config here is the trap. A switch, a checkbox and a
  pre-ticked consent row always draw in their off state, and neither their `propsByState` nor
  their default can be checked visually. Send the user to the Adapty app for those.
- **A `spinner`, layout-dependently.** Measured: the same `spinner` element drew in an
  isolated probe and drew **nothing** inside a centred loading screen, while `validate` returned
  `valid: true` and the device drew the screen's other elements fine. Which layouts suppress it is
  **not isolated**, so a blank where a spinner should be is *unproven, not broken* — and the
  rotation is a device check either way, since a still PNG could not show it even if the glyph
  drew. What this blindness must never license is a repair: swapping the `spinner` for a static
  ring `icon` makes the screenshot look complete and ships something that does not animate
  ([patterns.md → a loading screen](patterns.md#a-loading-screen--fill-the-loader-spinner-label-template-never-fake-the-spinner)).
- **Any locale but the one it draws.** The render ignores `defaultLocale` and the order of
  `locales[]` — measured: forcing `defaultLocale: "de"`, and putting `de` first, both produced
  byte-identical screenshots to the untouched file. **A locale transform therefore cannot be
  verified visually at all.** Say so, and tell the user to switch locale in the builder and look
  for overflow, because translated text is routinely longer than its source.
- **Anything resolving at runtime.** Real prices, store currency, user input. Placeholder `$0.00`
  prices and broken asset URLs are usually the preview lacking data, not a defect you introduced —
  and a price variable in particular renders as the full literal `{{<uuid>.prod_price}}`, which is
  *far longer than any price*. It wraps to extra lines and can push text under a docked CTA, so the
  screenshot shows an overlap that will not exist once the price resolves. **Never restyle a layout
  to fix crowding you only see around a token.** Substitute a plausible price into a throwaway copy
  of the config, render that, and judge the layout at production text length. And when an element
  is missing rather than merely crowded, render the *source* config too and compare before blaming
  your own edit.

- **Navigation, so the flow cannot be walked.** The page renders the screen named by `--screen`
  and stops there: measured on a two-screen config, a button carrying a `navigate` action left the
  page unchanged across two real clicks and a synthetic one. Every screen therefore needs its own
  render, and **branching cannot be checked here at all** — a `conditional` fires on a tap that
  never resolves. Route coverage is an Adapty-app check, or a reading of the config.

  **A screen that advances itself is therefore 100% unverifiable here, and that changes how you
  hand it over.** Measured on a timed loading screen: after 15 s of
  `--virtual-time-budget` the dumped DOM was still the same screen. That result is *worthless as
  evidence* — the page never navigates for any reason, so a broken `timer-end` and a working one
  produce the identical observation. The consequence is a process one: when the only surface that
  can exercise a mechanism is the user's device, **build the diagnostic in before the first ask,
  not after the fourth.** A timed screen handed over bare yields one bit ("still spinning"); the
  same screen handed over with its countdown temporarily made visible — a child `text` carrying
  the `timer_minutes`/`timer_seconds` tokens — splits the failure in two at no extra cost to the
  user: *digits never appear or freeze* is the element not mounting, *digits reach zero and
  nothing happens* is the trigger not firing. Say it is temporary and remove it after. Paid for
  the hard way: four blind config tweaks were shipped to a user's device one at a time before
  anyone thought to make the timer visible, and the instrumentation cost exactly one cycle.

- **Text metrics that are not the device's — and a colour emoji is where it shows.** An emoji in a
  **hug**-width text box renders correctly here and is **clipped on iOS**: reported from a device
  screenshot of a flow whose preview was clean. The glyph's ink is wider than the advance width the
  layout engine measures, and a hug box leaves no slack. Give an emoji a **fixed box** — a fixed
  `width` and `height`, with `align: center` for the horizontal — and the same rule applies to any
  glyph you are hugging tightly. **Do not reach for `verticalAlign` here**: it is schema-legal on
  text and the transform service reports it `unsupported_text_typography_setting … will be
  ignored`, so it buys a warning per element and no centring
  ([flow-schema.md](flow-schema.md#verticalalign-precisely)). Vertical placement comes from the
  parent's `layout.alignV`.
  Team-confirmed independently in the support channel: the transformer measures a size-24 emoji as
  17px, and their recipe is the same — a fixed width (theirs: 28). This is the one blindness on the
  list with **no** preview-side symptom at all, so it cannot be found by iterating here: it is
  found on a device, or by a user.

- **An element id that cannot be an identifier — the black-screen class.** An element id is
  emitted as an **identifier in the generated runtime script**, so a character outside
  `[A-Za-z0-9_]` (a hyphen, a dot, a space) makes that script syntactically broken and the
  screen renders **black on device**. Nothing here can see it: this page draws the *config*, so
  it draws the screen correctly, and `flows config validate` passes a hyphenated id too
  ([validate.md](validate.md)). An id reused on a second screen collides in the same script.
  `verify-config.py` errors on both — **screen** ids are the exception and are left alone,
  because real published exports use a bare UUID for the entry screen
  ([flow-schema.md](flow-schema.md#element-and-screen-ids-become-identifiers)).

- **Which typeface the device will actually use.** The page loads the webfont from
  `_meta.fonts[].url`, so a custom face renders here from a URL alone. The device resolves it by
  **family name** out of the app bundle (`iosName` / `androidName`) and falls back to the system
  font, silently, when the file is not there — which is the normal state, since a font is not
  shipped by the flow ([flow-schema.md trap 8](flow-schema.md)). So a correct-looking heading in
  this render is not evidence about the face on a phone, and a font-carrying screen goes into the
  handoff as a named device check.

- **Any device but the frames the page knows, so a short-phone check is not available here.**
  `--device` defaults to `iphone-14`; `ipad-pro` appears in the CLI's own example. **The valid set
  is not enumerable** — it is not in the CLI package (`grep`ped) and not in the render page's
  entry bundle, and an id the page does not know renders `Unknown device "iphone-se".` as a
  **page**, with exit 0, which passes any "did something draw" check. So a layout whose safety
  depends on viewport height — `scrollable: false`, fixed heights, a tall content column
  ([flow-schema.md trap 10b](flow-schema.md)) — cannot be validated against a small phone from
  here. Reason about it structurally instead, and name it in the handoff. Note `--window-size` is
  **not** a substitute: the page draws its own device frame, so a smaller window crops the
  screenshot rather than re-laying-out the screen (measured — a 375×667 window returned
  the same 390pt-wide screen with its right edge cut off, which reads exactly like an overflow bug
  that is not there).

- **The device's own chrome — a notch, a Dynamic Island, a home indicator — because the render
  draws none of it.** A screen authored with `safeArea: false` put its back chevron and title into
  the island zone on a real phone (user-reported, 2026-08-24, from a device screenshot of a flow
  whose preview was clean) — the preview canvas starts at a bare top edge, so the collision has no
  preview-side tell. Author new screens with `safeArea: true` unless the design genuinely paints
  under the status bar. The same missing viewport frame hides the bottom half of the problem: an
  in-flow CTA that ends mid-canvas reads fine in a PNG and as a half-empty screen on a device —
  when the reference pins its CTA to the bottom, that is a `fixed` dock
  ([patterns.md → a bottom-docked button](patterns.md)), not a flow item, and docked-over-scrolling
  content then needs a look at *both* ends: measured in the same session, a docked footnote
  collided with the last content row at one viewport height and cleared it at another.

- **Invisible text defects.** Copy-pasted text carries empty paragraph lines and trailing spaces
  the preview does not show and the device does — one stray Enter produced a device-only vertical
  gap that took the support team days to find. Deliberate gaps are separate Text and Spacing
  elements, never blank lines inside a rich-text value.
- **Prices are hardcoded stubs, everywhere short of a real app.** The builder preview's "3.99" is
  a literal number in the page's code, and the Adapty preview app's prices are mocks too
  (team-stated) — so no preview surface proves a price, an offer, or trial eligibility; only the
  client's own app does. An offer configured as a free trial resolves to 0 where it resolves at
  all.

## An element that fails to paint is not automatically yours to fix

**An element that fails to paint is not automatically yours to fix.** A `position: fixed` CTA
rendering as an empty band — laid out, occupying its height, painting nothing — is a *reported
renderer defect* on this page, isolated by bisection to `props.position.type == "fixed"` on a
`schemaVersion` 9 flow. It did **not** reproduce here: on a v10 config, both docked forms
(`left`/`right` + `width: auto`, and `bottom` alone + a fixed width) paint correctly. So treat a
missing element as a question, not a verdict — render the *source* config and compare before you
restyle anything. Deleting a working `position` to make a screenshot look right is how a correct
config gets broken.

## The mismatch class is systemic, in both directions

The support channel treats preview-vs-device disagreement as a standing class, not an anomaly, and
it runs **both ways**: a carousel that renders correctly in the builder preview and breaks on
device, and a deliberately device-correct config that "looks broken in the builder" — the team's
own workaround author could not make one config look right on both. Standing team guidance since
May 2026: margins, padding and borders "can differ between preview and real device, so do the
final check on the device." Which is what phase 5's callout hands to the user.

## Four surfaces, and they do not agree

**A clean preview does not prove the builder will open the flow.** The preview page and the
Flow Builder's editor are different renderers, and the two configs that broke the builder in
this project's history both render here. So report a good screenshot as "this looked right at
this size", never as "the flow works".

**There are four surfaces and they do not agree.** Know which one you are quoting:

| Surface | What it tells you |
| :--- | :--- |
| `config preview` + a screenshot | fast, scriptable, and a *different renderer* — layout and spacing only |
| the **Adapty mobile app** | two things at once. The real **SDK** renderer — the only preview that reflects what a user gets, and therefore the one that would surface an `unsupported_…_setting` the transform service warned about. And the strictest *validator* you can reach: it runs the transform service, which `config update` does not, so on a newly authored flow it returns 422 for a missing `flowProductId` until the flow has been published once |
| the Flow Builder editor | whether the authoring tool can open it; where the user reviews and publishes |
| published and live | the truth, and the only state your users ever see |

You can reach the first. Everything below it belongs to the user, which is why the callout in phase 5
asks for the mobile-app preview explicitly rather than treating a screenshot as sign-off.

## Which layer owns the defect

The table above reads one way — what a surface proves. Read it the other way and the **pattern of
disagreement** narrows the cause down before you touch anything, which is the difference between a
diagnosis and a guess. Four layers can own a defect: the **config data** you are holding, the
**preview page** (Chromium and CSS), the **transform service** (config → SDK document), and the
**SDK renderer** (native). Route by what agrees with what:

| What you observe | The layer to suspect first |
| :--- | :--- |
| wrong in the preview **and** on the device | the **config data** — and that is the good case, because it is the only layer you can fix |
| right in the preview, wrong on the device | the **transformer or the SDK**. Check the known one-way blindnesses on this page before concluding it is a bug: an unsupported element type, a `propsByState` merge, a font, an id, an emoji |
| right on the device, wrong in the preview | the **preview page**. Do not restyle a config to make a screenshot look right — see the section above; that has broken working configs |
| the transform is green and the device is wrong | not a validation problem at all. Nothing you can publish differently will help; the defect is in one of the two layers downstream of the document |
| the flow will not open in the **builder** | the config data again, but a shape the *authoring tool* rejects rather than one the SDK does — a different renderer with its own failures, and both configs that broke it in this project's history render fine here |

Two rules that keep this honest, and both have cost this project a round:

- **A suspicious-looking shape in the JSON is not evidence of a bug, and a clean-looking one is
  not evidence of a fix.** The burden is on the claim, and the only thing that discharges it for
  the last two rows is a device.
- **Say which layer you are claiming, and say what would show it.** "The preview draws it and the
  device does not, and the schema flags that element type as having no mapper" is a diagnosis.
  "The layout looks broken" is a screenshot.

## The mobile-app link, and why it is not the render URL

**You can hand the user a link straight into surface 2 instead of describing it.** The Flow
Builder's "Test on Device" button is a QR over a plain URL, and that URL is pure string
construction — no network, no auth, nothing from Adapty's servers:

```
https://mobile-app.adapty.io/flow-preview?app_id=<uuid>&flow_id=<uuid>&current_locale=en&locales=en,uk&cluster=us
```

[`mobile-preview.mjs`](mobile-preview.mjs) builds it and renders the QR. Everything it needs is
already in your hands by phase 5: the two ids, and `locales`/`defaultLocale` off the config.

**It previews what is SAVED, not your local file — the exact opposite of `config preview`.** The app
opens the link and fetches the flow's current draft from Adapty. So it is a phase-5 tool that runs
*after* `config update`; built before the write, it shows the previous version and reads as "the
agent's edit did nothing". The upside of that fetch: one link stays valid across later writes, so
hand it over once rather than regenerating it per change.

**And it is the DRAFT it fetches — which is the first question to ask when the user says they
published and the device did not change.** The app has its own handle and does not need a publish;
the dashboard's own device preview shows the **published** version. So the two surfaces read two
different snapshots of the same flow, and the commonest cause of "I published and nothing changed"
is not propagation or caching but a comparison across that boundary. Establish which surface the
user is looking at *before* diagnosing anything downstream:

| What they are looking at | What it shows |
| :--- | :--- |
| the `mobile-app.adapty.io` link (this one, or the builder's Test on Device QR) | the current **draft** — your last `config update`, published or not |
| the dashboard's device preview | the **published** version — unchanged until they press publish |
| their own app, through the SDK | the **published** version, and the only one their users see |

Two consequences. A user who checks the link after your write sees the change *without publishing*,
which is what makes phase 5's callout honest — and also why nobody should read "it looks right on
my phone" as "it is live". And a user still on the dashboard preview will report your change as
missing until they publish, correctly.

**Do not leave the preview open while the flow is being edited.** The draft save and an open
preview contend for the same draft, and the reported symptom is a save conflict rather than a
stale render. If a write comes back conflicting, the fix is the one the lock already implies:
re-read the config and re-apply, never force.

**Print this URL freely.** At ~170 characters it is the opposite of the render URL above — every
part of it is meaningful and a human may well need to read it aloud or retype it.

Three details worth not rediscovering:

- **`defaultLocale` holds a locale *id*, and the link wants a *code*.** The builder resolves id→code
  before building the URL. They are equal in every config seen so far, which is exactly why passing
  the id through would go unnoticed until the first flow where they differ.
- **The `locales` separator must be a literal comma.** Building the query with `URLSearchParams`
  percent-encodes it to `%2C`, and the app is only *known* to accept the builder's spelling. The
  script assembles the string by hand for that reason; a rendered QR has been decoded back to
  confirm the comma survives.
- **`cluster` is hardcoded `us`, and that is a real limitation, not an oversight.** The builder
  hardcodes it too, carrying a TODO to derive it from app config, and nothing on the developer API
  exposes an app's cluster. An EU or CN app therefore gets a US link from the dashboard and from
  this script alike. `--cluster` overrides it if you know better.

**What the link does not fix: the app is still the strictest validator you can reach.** On a newly
authored flow it returns 422 for a missing `flowProductId` until the flow has been published once —
see the surfaces table above. A link that opens to an error is the transform service talking, not a
broken link.

### The QR is a PNG, and there is no character-art form

`--qr` writes a 228x228 PNG (~4KB), opens it, and prints a markdown line to paste.

**The link is the deliverable; the QR is off unless asked for.** Without `--qr` the script prints the
link and nothing else — no PNG, no window, and `qrcode` is never even loaded.

**The two serve different readers, not different tastes.** Someone reading on the phone they want to
preview on taps the link and is done; a QR is useless to them, since they cannot point their only
camera at their own screen. The QR is for the reader on a laptop whose test device is a separate
thing they have to reach. So the link is unconditional, and offering "a QR instead of tapping the
link" is the wrong frame — it implies a choice where the phone reader already has everything they
need. Say it as two situations:

> On mobile, tap the link to preview. If you want a QR code to scan for device preview, just say so
> and I'll generate one.

**Base that decision only on what the user said.** Two drafts of this guidance keyed it on something
unobservable — first `$TERM` to guess whether images render, then "when the user is at a laptop and
about to test on a device" — and an unevaluable condition does not become a default, it becomes a
coin flip. You cannot see their desk. You can see their words: a QR they asked for, a QR they
declined, or no signal, in which case offer in one line and let them answer.

That is a general rule for this file: **a condition written here has to be one an agent can actually
check.** If it cannot, it will be resolved by guessing, and the guess will read as considered
behaviour.

`--qr` **opens the image** and prints a markdown line to paste. Emit that line whatever your surface
is: where images render the reader scans it inline, and where they do not Claude Code's terminal
shows `Scan to preview on your phone (flow-preview-qr-b49806c9.png)` — one readable line, measured.

**How the reachability line got here, because two earlier answers both left work for the reader:**

| Attempt | Why it failed |
| :--- | :--- |
| `file:///abs/path.png` | **not clickable in a terminal** (reported from a real one) — a path with seven useless characters in front of it |
| `open /abs/path.png` | reachable, but the reader still has to copy-paste before they can scan |
| **open it from the script** | a window with a code in it appears; nothing for them to do |

`flows config preview` already opens a browser on a TTY rather than handing over a URL, so this is
the established move in this skill rather than a new liberty. It is best-effort: headless hosts,
containers and `CI` have nothing to open with, so the script prints the opener command
(`open` / `xdg-open` / `start`) and the run is still fine. `--no-open` skips the attempt.

**Surface detection does not work, so do not attempt it.** `$TERM` and `tty` describe where your
*bash calls* run, not where your *answer* is rendered — a property of the subprocess against a
property of the reader's app, and they come apart over SSH, in containers, and in any client driving
a remote shell. The one data point in hand is a client with an empty `TERM` that rendered an inline
image perfectly, i.e. the heuristic pointing the wrong way.

Emitting both is safe precisely because the image line degrades to **one line** of alt text. That is
why the rule here inverts the one for character art, where the wrong surface produced 31 rows of
garbage and choosing correctly was the whole problem.

For the inline form the path must be **relative and inside the directory the client resolves from** —
an absolute one is refused, reported verbatim as *"This file is outside the working directory. It
can't be opened here."* Pass `--md-base <that directory>`; the script warns instead if the image
landed outside it.

**Do not shrink the PNG further without a real phone.** 228px is ~0.9mm per module on a 110dpi
screen. What a camera needs is module size, and the matrix does not shrink just because the image
does — a 53-module code at 171px is 0.69mm and unproven.

#### Why there is no terminal QR, after two attempts at one

A half-block QR was built twice and removed twice. Three findings, in the order they landed, and any
one of them is disqualifying:

**It cannot survive a rendered answer.** The grid packs two module rows into each text line, so those
rows must touch. Rasterizing the layout with a line gap inserted — which every markdown renderer's
line-height does — and decoding it:

| Module size | Line gap | Decodes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 6px | **0%** | **yes** |
| 6px | 8% of the line | no |
| 10px | 5% of the line | no |

Zero tolerance. That confines the form to a terminal, where cells are contiguous and the gap is 0.

**`qrcode`'s own `type: 'terminal'` is wrong in two ways, both invisible on a light theme.** Its last
row is emitted as `ESC[0m ESC[37m ▀` per cell, so the glyph lands on the terminal's *default*
background instead of the white one every other row sets — white-on-white and correct on a light
theme, a white stripe with no bottom quiet zone on a dark one. And its quiet zone is about 5 module
rows in total where the spec wants 4 **per side**. Both were found by running it in a real terminal
and reading the bytes. If anyone tries a third time: render the block yourself, do not call that.

**And then it is simply too big, which is arithmetic rather than a bug.** A correctly rendered block
for this link is **31 rows x 61 cols**. The only lever is the payload, and it barely moves:

| Payload change | Lines | Cost |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| none | 31 | — |
| error correction L | 29 | less damage tolerance |
| drop `cluster` | 29 | the app must default it |
| drop `locales` too | 25 | the app must read them from the config it fetches |
| + uppercase UUIDs (alphanumeric mode) | 25 | the app must accept uppercase |
| + drop `https://` | 23 | breaks universal-link handling |

Stripping everything buys 31 to 23 lines for three unverifiable changes to a URL already confirmed
to scan on a device. A 173-character URL is a 53-module code, and 53 modules at two rows per line is
31 lines. **So the terminal answer is the `file://` link**, which is one line and opens something
that scans properly.

**Verified end to end**: the PNG was decoded back to the exact URL by an independent decoder, then
scanned off a screen with a real phone, which opened the flow in the Adapty app. The inline form was
confirmed to render in a desktop client.

## When the render fails: the file input, not a smaller config

**Do not decide whether to preview from the file size.** The command's own help calls it a
quick-look escape hatch and mentions ~32KB of pretty-printed JSON as the point where the render page
gets slow. That is a symptom to watch for, **not a budget to check a config against** — and two
agents used it as grounds to skip previewing entirely, on configs that render fine. Measured:
a 171KB config renders, and so does a 143KB one; gzip in the fragment is very effective, so 56KB of
config yields a 6,349-character URL. Always try the preview. If the render comes back slow,
truncated or blank, *then* fall back to the dashboard.

**When the URL render fails, switch to the file input — do not shrink the config.** `preview` packs
the whole config into the URL fragment, and on a large flow the failure is not an Adapty limit: the
page's third-party analytics beacons put `location.href` into their own query strings, so a 113K
hash becomes a 113K beacon request, the beacon host answers **414**, and the app's own assets die
as collateral on the torn-down connection — the bundle never boots and you screenshot an error
page. Reported for a 668KB flow; loads at a 32K fragment, hangs at 64K.

The escape hatch is [`preview-with-playwright.mjs`](preview-with-playwright.mjs), which
opens the render page on a **short** URL and hands the config to its file input
(`[data-testid="preview-config-input"]`) instead. Same page, same renderer, no fragment. The same
668KB flow that fails through the URL renders that way in 6-8 seconds.

**`--device` is not validated — a wrong value renders a page, not an error.** The flag accepts any
string, exits 0, and the render page answers an unrecognized id with the words
`Unknown device "…"` on a blank background. That screenshot carries a few hundred distinct colours
from text antialiasing, so it survives a naive "did anything draw" check and looks like a successful
preview. `iphone-14` (the default) and `iphone-13-mini` are confirmed to work; `iphone-se`,
`iphone-12-mini`, `iphone-8` and `pixel-7` are not recognized, and there is no published list. So
stay on the default unless you have a reason to change it, and if you do pass `--device`, confirm
the image shows the frame you asked for rather than that message.

**Check that you screenshotted the flow at all.** The page answers a bad `--device` with
`Unknown device "…"` as a *page*, a broken fragment with an error page, and a wrong host with a
login screen — all of which are PNGs that pass a "did anything draw" test. Before you reason about
a render, confirm it shows the screen you asked for.
