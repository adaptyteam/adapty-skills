"""Is this flow ready for production?

Structural, offline half of the `flow-audit` skill. Takes a flow config and the app's
product catalog; returns findings. No network, no CLI calls -- `SKILL.md` owns those, so
this script stays testable against fixtures.

Severity is a verdict input, not a mood:
  blocker  -- the flow will not work for a real user, OR will show them something false
  risk     -- it works and is probably not what anyone intended
  question -- not decidable from the data available; state what you could not see

Every check here is calibrated in both directions against `tests/fixtures/`. See
`checks.md` before changing one -- most of these were wrong on first contact with real
data, and the traps are recorded there.

Usage:
  audit-flow.py <config.json> [--catalog <catalog.json>] [--stores ios,android]
                [--json | --report] [--name <name>] [--flow-id <id>] [--status <status>]
Exit: 0 no blockers, 1 at least one blocker, 2 usage or unreadable input.

`--json` prints the raw findings; `--report` prints the user-facing report (verdict,
BLOCKERS/RISKS/COULD NOT CHECK, locale coverage, BEFORE YOU SHIP) and the two are
mutually exclusive. `--name`/`--flow-id`/`--status` come from `flows list`, not the
config, and feed `render()`'s header and the `flow-untitled` check.

# no ancestor is wired, and the whole flow contains no `restorePurchases` action and no

# into one element ("Restore purchase · Terms · Privacy" -- `el_089T` in
# `onboarding-multilocale.json`), then treat a segment as an affordance only when the

# word, or the word plus one of a small closed set of qualifiers that still read as a

# than falling through, because "month"/"mo"/"mos" all fail their own trailing `\b`

# A period word is a genuine billing CLAIM only in a price/billing context -- never

# card's text to "Pro | Weekly progress reports" read as a WEEKLY period claim purely
# because the benefit sentence contains the word "weekly"; `period_terms` also
# returned {monthly} for "Cancel anytime, no monthly fees" (near-boilerplate),
# {annual} for "Save 50% a year" (a savings claim, not a period), and {monthly} for
# "Your monthly report" (a feature, not a plan). The real corpus is terse ("Yearly",
# "Monthly", "12 mo • $79.99"), which is exactly why calibration never caught this --
# every real card's period word WAS the whole point of its segment, so "present
# anywhere" and "in billing context" happened to coincide.
#
# `card_text` joins a card's descendant text elements with " | ", so context is
# judged per SEGMENT, split on that same separator -- one product card's own price
# line must not lend a neighbouring benefit line's unrelated period word legitimacy
# just because `card_text` concatenated them into one blob. Within a segment, a
# period match counts as a claim when EITHER removing the matched text leaves
# nothing but whitespace/punctuation or a bare plan noun (`monthly` alone, or
# `12-month plan`'s trailing `plan` -- the segment names nothing else), OR the
# segment carries a currency amount (`MONEY_RE`), a `/` rate marker (already part of
# several `PERIOD_RULES` alternatives, e.g. `/mo`), or a billing verb (`billed`,
# `per`, `every`, `renews`). A price-VARIABLE's own text never reaches this
# function at all -- `card_text` calls `flat_text`, which renders a `variable` node

    Notice, verbatim: "The auto-renewable subscription displays the monthly calculated
    pricing for the subscription more clearly and conspicuously than the billed
    amount." The customer had to change every active paywall.

    `billed-amount-not-shown` is the hard case: a derived per-unit figure is drawn and
    the amount the store will actually charge appears NOWHERE on the screen.
    `derived-price-louder` is the soft one: both are drawn, and the derived figure wins
    on size or weight. Both are `risk`, because "conspicuously" is a judgement over
    colour, position and container as well as type, and this reads only type.

    Unknown period -> `question`. With no catalog row there is no `period`, so which
    suffix IS the billed amount is undecidable -- and guessing produced a measured
    false positive on `onboarding-quiz-paywall.json`, whose per-year + per-month pair
    is the COMPLIANT shape.

    But that question is SUPPRESSED whenever the missing catalog row is already
    reported: its entire content would be "I could not find that product in the
    catalog", which the report has said once already, and this check would repeat it
    once per (screen, product). Measured on `onboarding-quiz-paywall.json`: two
    `product-not-in-catalog` blockers plus two advisory questions saying the same
    thing; with `--catalog` omitted, one `catalog-not-fetched` question plus one
    advisory question per price site. This file establishes the pattern twice already
    -- `check_products_catalog` returns after a single `catalog-not-fetched`, and
    `check_period_claim` returns on a falsy catalog. The question survives only for
    the two cases nothing else covers, and they get DIFFERENT wording because a
    single sentence was wrong for one of them: a product that IS in the catalog whose
    row carries no `period`, and a product reached only through a price variable --

    auto-renewable subscriptions must include all of the following required information
    in the binary: Title of auto-renewing subscription; Length of subscription; Price of
    subscription, and price per unit if appropriate; Functional links to the privacy
    policy and Terms of Use (EULA)." Terms and privacy are already covered by
    `no-terms-link`/`no-privacy-link`. This function covers the other two: LENGTH
    (`no-period-disclosed`) and what happens when a free trial ends
    (`trial-terms-incomplete`).

    Screen-scoped and reported ONCE per screen. The period may legitimately be stated
    outside the card -- "Billed yearly" under the CTA discloses it for every card above
    -- so a card-scoped test would flag a compliant layout, and one row per card would
    bury four identical findings in the report.

    Reuses `period_terms`, so it inherits that function's billing-context guard, which
    took four measured false positives to get right ("Weekly progress reports" read as a
    weekly billing claim). Inverted here for `no-period-disclosed`: the check is that NO
    period term appears anywhere on the screen.

    Both checks read the same per-screen `blob`, so a screen with neither a stated
    period nor stated trial terms produces both findings -- deliberately: they are two
    separate disclosures and a user reading the report should see both gaps, not just
    whichever the code happened to check first.
